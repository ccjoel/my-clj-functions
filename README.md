# my-clj-snippets

Bunch of functions and playing around with clojure

Solves a couple of programming problems:

- Odometer: better solution since my crappy college source code
- coin challenge: non-optimal, but who's watching anyways
- all combinations of sums to a hundred given a number sequence; this was fun
- other unicode / escape utils..
- notes and personal cheatsheet on cider, emacs, clojure basics...

## Usage

use repl, no main entry points.
